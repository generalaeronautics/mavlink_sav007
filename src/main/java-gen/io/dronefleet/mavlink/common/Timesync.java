/**
 * Time synchronization message. The message is used for both timesync requests and responses. 
 * The request is sent with `ts1=syncing component timestamp` and `tc1=0`, and may be broadcast 
 * or targeted to a specific system/component. The response is sent with `ts1=syncing component 
 * timestamp` (mirror back unchanged), and `tc1=responding component timestamp`, with the 
 * `target_system` and `target_component` set to ids of the original request. Systems can 
 * determine if they are receiving a request or response based on the value of `tc`. If the response 
 * has `target_system==target_component==0` the remote system has not been updated to use the 
 * component IDs and cannot reliably timesync; the requestor may report an error. Timestamps are 
 * UNIX Epoch time or time since system boot in nanoseconds (the timestamp format can be inferred 
 * by checking for the magnitude of the number; generally it doesn't matter as only the offset is 
 * used). The message sequence is repeated numerous times with results being filtered/averaged 
 * to estimate the offset.
